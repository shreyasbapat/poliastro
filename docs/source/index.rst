**poliastro** is an open source (MIT) collection of Python functions useful
in Astrodynamics and Orbital Mechanics, focusing on interplanetary applications.
It provides a simple and intuitive API and handles physical quantities with
units.

Some of its awesome features are:

* Analytical and numerical orbit propagation
* Conversion between position and velocity vectors and classical orbital
  elements
* Coordinate frame transformations
* Hohmann and bielliptic maneuvers computation
* Trajectory plotting
* Initial orbit determination (Lambert problem)
* Planetary ephemerides (using SPICE kernels via Astropy)
* Computation of Near-Earth Objects (NEOs)

And more to come!

poliastro is developed by an open, international community. Release
announcements and general discussion take place on our `mailing list`_
and `chat`_.

The `source code`_, `issue tracker`_ and `wiki`_ are hosted on GitHub, and all
contributions and feedback are more than welcome. You can test poliastro in your
browser using binder, a cloud Jupyter notebook server:

poliastro works on recent versions of Python and is released under
the MIT license, hence allowing commercial use of the library.

.. code-block:: python

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    plt.ion()

    from poliastro.examples import molniya
    from poliastro.plotting import plot

    plot(molniya)

.. note::
    Older versions of poliastro relied on some Fortran subroutines written by David A. Vallado for
    his book "Fundamentals of Astrodynamics and Applications" and available on
    the Internet as the `companion software of the book`__.
    The author explicitly gave permission to redistribute these subroutines
    in this project under a permissive license.
